# EV Vehicle Charging Demand Prediction 🚗⚡

## 📌 Project Title:
**EV Vehicle/Charging Demand Prediction**

## 👨‍💻 Intern:
**Karan Kumar**  
Batch Code: `JUL_AIML_4`  
AICTE Virtual Internship (AI/ML)

## 🧠 Project Overview:
This project focuses on predicting the **charging demand** of Electric Vehicles (EVs) based on the number of EVs registered.  
Using Machine Learning (Linear Regression), we built a model that forecasts expected charging sessions from new EV registration data.
